This github repository contains the created knowledge graph, the CRAM action designator and additional resources created by following [our methodology](https://food-ninja.github.io/FoodCutting/Methodology.html).
Additionally, the `food_extraction` folder contains all intermediate results used for extracting knowledge about fruits and vegetables from the [FoodOn](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-018-0032-6).
For the simulation of the cutting task, please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/Food-Ninja/FoodNinjaSimulation) instead.
